MobiVote
========

MobiVote is an Android application for Boardroom voting. It allows
spontaneous verifiable and secure e-voting for a small group of people
present at the same location. It is built upon an existing cryptographic
protocol specially designed for the mentioned purpose. No central
infrastructure is required, thus only Android devices are needed in
order to run an election. 

An user manual of the application can be found in the appendix of this document:
